- 👋 Hi, I’m @Smudge04
- 👀 I’m interested in all things computing!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how on earth to navigate everything! I have taken the smart choice of doing everything at once, so self-management will be needed...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small projects to boost my skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: Using any of the linked social media accounts I have on my page, please reach out if you need anything!
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can speak Gaidhlig (Gaelic in English), I love to learn new instruments, and I have played gigs in the Barrowlands, and in all the concert halls in Glasgow!
